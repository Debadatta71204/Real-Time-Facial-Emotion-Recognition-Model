# 😐 FER2013 Dataset Overview

This project uses the **FER2013 (Facial Expression Recognition 2013)** dataset, which is structured into `train` and `test` folders.

Each subfolder contains grayscale images (48x48) of facial expressions, categorized by emotion.

## 📉 Data Imbalance & Augmentation

The original training data was **highly imbalanced**, with certain classes (like "disgust") having significantly fewer samples than others.

To address this issue:

- I **augmented the training dataset** using transformations such as:
  - Horizontal flipping
  - Rotation
  - Zoom
  - Brightness adjustments
  - Shifts

The augmented dataset ensures a better balance across all emotion classes, which helps improve model generalization.
